      <strong>Mexican-Style Burritos With Machaca Guisada (Braised Dried-Beef)</strong><br>
      Mexican burritos are a bit different from their counterparts north of the border. Most importantly, they're smaller and stuffed with a much simpler array of fillings (often just one, like the braised beef here). With such a pared-down presentation, the key to success is quality: The tortillas are best homemade and the filling abundantly delicious.
