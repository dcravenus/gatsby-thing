      <strong>Real Irish Soda Bread Recipe</strong><br>
      Once upon a time, soda bread was baked over hot coals in a covered skillet, trapping steam from the dough to produce a wonderfully crusty loaf of breadâ€”a setup anyone can re-create in a Dutch oven. Teamed up with low-protein all-purpose flour and volatile baking soda, buttermilk hits the sweet spot of gluten and carbon dioxide formation, creating a moist and fluffy soda bread that's chewy and crusty all at once.
