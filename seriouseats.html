      <strong>Milk Creams (Indian Cashew Sweets)</strong><br>
      Milk creams are a classic sweet served as little bites during the Christmas holidays in India. A mixture of sweetened cashews and milk are transformed into a soft dough that can be placed into decorative molds or shaped into discs.
